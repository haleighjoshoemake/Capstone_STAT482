## Forest Loss and the Rise of Zoonotic Illnesses in Sub-Saharan Africa
### 1.1 Introduction
Zoonotic diseases have been a prevalent global health challenge, spreading from animals to humans and causing significant illness. When natural habitats are destroyed, wildlife such as birds, mosquitoes, and other vectors are pushed closer to human populations, increasing the risk of disease transmission. Among these, mosquitoes are notorious for spreading malaria, a life-threatening disease. Malaria symptoms include fever, chills, and flu-like illness, with severe cases leading to complications like anemia, respiratory distress, and death.
Forests are critical in maintaining ecological balance and preventing zoonotic diseases like malaria. When deforestation clears forests, it disrupts mosquitoes' natural habitat, forcing them to migrate into urban and rural areas, where they frequently contact human populations. Deforestation, whether for agricultural expansion, logging, or urbanization, exacerbates this problem by increasing exposure and facilitating the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.
### 1.2 Importance of the Study
This study is vital as it addresses the critical intersection between environmental degradation and public health, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. By exploring the relationship between forest cover loss and malaria incidence, the research offers insights into how habitat destruction may exacerbate the spread of zoonotic diseases. As forest cover loss forces wildlife, including mosquitoes, closer to human populations, the risk of disease transmission, such as malaria, increases. Understanding these environmental drivers is essential for creating public health strategies that account for the impacts of environmental change, particularly in regions most vulnerable to malaria outbreaks.
### 1.3 Aim
The primary aim of this study is to explore whether there is an association between the Percentage of Forest Area (PFA), which represents the proportion of a countryâ€™s landmass covered by forest, and malaria incidence rates in Sub-Saharan African countries. Specifically, the research will investigate how changes in forest cover may influence mosquito migration patterns, as mosquitoes are the primary malaria vectors, and whether this leads to increased human exposure to the disease. The goal is to determine if reduced forest cover correlates with higher malaria rates, providing insights into the potential link between deforestation and public health risks.
## 2. Data Collection
### 2.1 Forest Cover Data
Data from Global Forest Watch will provide information on forest cover changes, deforestation rates, and forest loss in various regions, with key metrics including the total forest area, percentage of forest cover, and deforestation rates over time. Additionally, data from the World Bank will be used to analyze long-term trends in forest areas. This will offer a broader view of forest dynamics and land-use changes over multiple decades, allowing for comprehensive trend analysis.
### 2.2 Zoonotic Disease Data
This study will use malaria incidence data from the World Health Organization (WHO) to examine the relationship between forest cover and malaria incidence. The dataset will include the number of malaria cases, geographical distribution, and associated mortality rates in Sub-Saharan African countries. This will be complemented by additional health data from Gapminder, which will provide more contextual information on health outcomes across the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, helping to assess any association between forest loss and malaria transmission patterns.
## 3. Research Strategy
### 3.1 Hypothesis
The primary hypothesis guiding the analysis is that there is an association between forest cover loss and malaria incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the study proposes that countries experiencing more significant forest cover loss are more likely to see an increase in malaria incidence rates. This potential increase may be driven by environmental changes that disrupt mosquito habitats, promote migration, or heighten human exposure to malaria-carrying vectors. By examining this relationship, the study aims to provide valuable insights into how forest cover loss impacts malaria transmission, which could inform both public health policy and environmental conservation efforts.
### 3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) will identify trends and associations between forest cover loss and malaria incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa. We will utilize histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to visualize trends between our covariates and malaria incidence rates across countries in the area of Sub-Saharan Africa. A correlation matrix will also help us understand the association between our covariates and explanatory variable before applying statistical methods for modeling. 

### 3.3 Statistical Method I: Multiple Linear Regression by Year
Multiple linear regression will assess the association between forest cover loss and malaria incidence. This method will allow for the analysis of how forest cover loss and other control variables, such as population density, urbanization, and socioeconomic factors, predict malaria incidence across Sub-Saharan African countries. This approach assumes that forest cover loss has a linear effect on malaria incidence, and it will provide insight into which factors have the most decisive influence on disease prevalence.
### 3.4 Statistical Method II: Mixed Effects Model
In addition to multiple linear regression, a mixed effects model with be utilized to understand the interactions between forest cover loss and malaria incidence. The year, rainfall depth, and urbanization rates will be fixed effects, while the forest cover will be a random effect in the model. This model will help us see if the effect of forest cover percentage on malaria incidence rates can be explained by country variances.
